# Background
This project utilizes Python and Pandas to analyze a city's school district data, aiming to assist the school board and mayor in making informed decisions about future school budgets and priorities. It leverages two datasets in CSV format: one detailing school-specific information such as size, type, and budget, and another focusing on student-specific data, including performance in math and reading. These datasets were imported, merged, and analyzed using Pandas DataFrames in a Jupyter Notebook environment, providing insights through a consolidated analysis report. The project focuses on trends in student performance, comparing outcomes in charter versus district schools, and assessing the relationship between standardized test results and school budgets to guide strategic planning.
